## v1.0.0

## Notes
- There is ABSOLUTLEY NO randomness in this. This is 100% deterministic. EXCEPT for the level generation (not toggled) & candy Spawning.
- make sure you vs opp turn it is makes it into the state
- I can either go off the assumption that for every 1 node taking 20 inputs, it need 5 nodes in the middle, OR can try some NEAT inspired implementation.
- don't forget if all else fails I can force 1 hot encoding for any network
- deriv of sigmoid is fucking bonk, it will not work for me, but I think it is close enough to use, so just add the summation of all output nodes & it should be alright.
- THE SMALLER EPSILON IS (change in input) THE MORE ACCURATE DERV OF SIGMOID IS, THATS JUST CALCULUS BABY
- if training doesn't work out, I can try beefing up the NN architecture, or adding memory to the reward (use the 3 outputs to try & predict the future & obtain a totalReward[i] vector for a few timesteps ahead.)
- For graphing, graph the accumulative reward over time ( r=0; r+=2; r+= -3; r+=2 ...)
- try an AI that cycles, att, def, taunt
- Training strats:
- - Berserk Slayer -> Berserk (Locked); BS_Pupil -> Berserk_Slayer(Locked); Pupil -> BS_Pupil(Locked)
- - Some new NN vs itself
- - Thing 1 vs Thing 2
- - Ground a neural network by training it vs random output, then train it against something with more strategy
- - Beserk_Slayer vs New NN, both learn to get better
- NN Problem solutions
- - Investigate if NN is wired right
- - Try a smaller learning rate
- - Train for long
- If letting the AI train all night vs Beserk Slayer doesn't work, look into [ rewards / adjustable LR / NN connections / making NN bigger ]
- Att -> Def: Currently 

## Authors Note
- I initially was meaning to create a very complex AI system comprised of 4 parts, but after about 6 weeks of development, I realized how much time the grand vision would of taken to complete
- I suspect the closer you get to a brain size of 128, the more useless nodes you'll end up having, but again this is a suspicion, not tested
- I really wanted to add the ability for an AI to learn from user input, but I just ended up getting to lazy to hack this in, more bothered by having to figure out how to work it into the UI than anything
- when I made the video, I did 90% of my training with a learning rate of .01
- I would love to see someone discover some really cool edge cases with this project
- I really wanted to make a tournament mode feature
- I absolutely hate the battle win chime, I made it quickly in 10m, meaning to go back & improve / finish it, but at this point in time, its been way too much time sunk into this project
- I have not experimented enough with this project, but I have learned a lot, & want to take all of my failures & successes, learn from them, & make the next AI-In-Games project even better!

### To-Do
|Version|Date|Thing|Note
|-|-|-|-
|||Fixed the ran away feature for Humans
|||Fixed the Neural Network confusion for player 2

## Polish
|Version|Date|Thing|Note
|-|-|-|-
|||Added the ability to adjust the learning rate in the battle menu
|||Now saves stats about the AI to the data file, like how many battles it's been in | x/y battles, y total battles, x of which it has learned from
|||You can now press esc in battle, menu pops up & you can select restart or main menu
|||Automatically generates Bots list if it doesn't exist
|||Added 2 random Haxbots from the Bots directory to the main menu
|||Added menu music
|||Added a NN input visualizers | steal the visualizer used in ML Hoops 21
|||Added a little circle that shows up when you're selecting where to move
|||Now saving AI choice in menu select that persists even after battles
|||Added hp & decisions to taskbar
|||Added a rounds display in battle, as well at the rounds graphs
|||Added a reset & exit button to battle
|||Added helmets
|||Removed the weird thing on the Haxbots

### Perfect World
|Version|Date|Thing|Note
|-|-|-|-
|||Added the functionality to increase a previously made brain size|Pad the endout with zeros? <- This will def work for new inputs im sure of it
|||Learning is split into 2|Learn: Changes weights in real time, & saves everything the network learns, Adapt: Also changes weights in real time, but does not save everything the network learns. Acts as like a baseline knowledge, then fit it to the current opponent.
|||Now added a complex local minimum algorithm that attempts to prevent AIs from getting stuck in a local minima
|||AI now learns their own reward outcome instead of being set by developer
|||You can now train a NN via a human player
|||Added a ML AI for Movement
|||Added a battle replay feature
|||The crowd now reacts to the battle with cheers
|||Added crowd SFX
|||Added a dummy AI|can simply just create a state hierarchy based on hp in 1/4 increments
|||model new coliseum
|||units no longer get stuck in corners
|||Maybe add like a special attack
|||fixed level loader to read it properly
|||Added a level builder

|v0.0.47|03.31.020|Added 6 more inputs to state data | sum of last 10 choices / 10, myAtt, myDef, myTaunt, oppAtt, oppDef, oppTaunt. Tech: this is a list of Actions, that sums all of the 3 actions & / list count, & if list count > 10 then remove the first element. This will essentially ask: based on the past 10 or less battle actions, what is the distribution?
